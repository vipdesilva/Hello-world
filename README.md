# Hello-world

## Introduction
This is a test repository started so that I can experiment with how git works.

## Conclusion
The text editor works easily enough - now to try a few other things
Firstly I need to try and get the local machine connected
Now that the machine is connected via ssh, I am playing with the files to see how the cloning works across to new devices
